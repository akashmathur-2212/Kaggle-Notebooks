# Kaggle-Notebooks

## Introduction
Hello User, I have started my journey on Kaggle and will be actively updating this repository. These notebooks aim to cover various lifecyle of Data Science projects and will help you  bulid intelligent models. I have explained codes and their relevance using Markdown. 

All source code are available both on GitHub and Kaggle. Please use below Links to explore further.
###### Let's learn together :metal:

## 1. Bitcoin Price Prediction
This notebook includes historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for Data mining. We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model building, Model selection and will predict bitcoin price using Stochastic, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

#### Quick Snapshot of Models used -
- ARIMA
- Facebook Prophet
- XGBoost
- LSTM
