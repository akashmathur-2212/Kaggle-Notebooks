# Kaggle-Notebooks

## Introduction
Hello User, I have started my journey on Kaggle and will be actively updating this repository. These notebooks aim to cover various lifecyle of Data Science projects and will help you  bulid intelligent models. I have explained codes and their relevance using Markdown. 

All source code are available both on GitHub and Kaggle. Please use below Links to explore further. Let's learn together :metal:

## 1. Bitcoin Price Prediction
This notebook includes historical bitcoin market data at 1-min intervals for Data mining. We will perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Model building, Model selection and will predict bitcoin price using Stochastic, Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

#### Quick Snapshot of Models used -
- ARIMA
- Facebook Prophet
- XGBoost
- LSTM

## 2. M5 Forecasting
In this challenge, we have to predict Walmart sales for future 28 days based on heirarchical sales in the states of California, Texas, and Wisconsin. “Hierarchical” means that data can be aggregated on different levels: item level, department level, product category level, and state level. In addition, we are also given corresponding data on prices, promotions, and holidays which can be merged with sales data to draw insights.

In this notebook, I will provide comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis on the entire dataset. I shall be using Plotly(mostly) and Matplotlib.
